## Data Types
# Value Types
- Value type stores its actual Value directly in the Stack memory.
- 
# Reference Types
- While a Reference type only stores a Reference in the Stack memory.
# Therefore, it is also possible to have two or more variables of a reference type that reference exactly the same value.

## The C# language also supports pointer types
