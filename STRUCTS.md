## Structs
- Within structs, you have access to many built-in types, which could be used either as keywords or types from the System namespace.

# Integer Values
- you can use one of the following types: Byte (the byte keyword), SByte (sbyte), Int16 (short), UInt16 (ushort), Int32 (int), UInt32 (uint), Int64 (long), and UInt64 (ulong).
- They differ by the number of bytes for storing values and therefore by the range of available values. As an example, the short data type supports values in the range from -32,768 to 32,767 while uint supports values in the range from 0 to 4,294,967,295
-  Another type within the integral types is Char (char), which represents a single Unicode character such as 'a' or 'A'.

# Floating-point values
- you can use two types, namely Single (float) and Double (double). The first uses 32 bits, while the second uses 64 bits. Thus, their precision differs significantly.

# Decimal type
- is available. It uses 128 bits and is a good choice for monetary calculations.
